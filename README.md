a# Multi-threaded Ticket Booking System

## Description
A multi-threaded ticket booking application developed in Java. It demonstrates concurrency management where vendors add tickets to a shared pool, and customers retrieve tickets at their specified rates. The project leverages synchronized methods to ensure thread-safe operations and showcases effective use of Java threading, encapsulation, and object-oriented programming principles.

## Features
- **Dynamic Ticket Management**: Vendors dynamically add tickets to the pool.
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Uses `synchronized` methods and `wait/notify` for safe multi-threading.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Set vendor/customer counts, ticket quantities, and retrieval rates.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily expandable for additional features like database integration or REST APIs.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Multi-threading and Concurrency
- Object-Oriented Programming
